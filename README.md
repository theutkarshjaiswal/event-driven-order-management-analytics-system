🚀 Event-Driven Order Management & Analytics System
📌 Overview
This project implements a microservices-based order management system with real-time event-driven communication using Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and containerized deployments via Docker & Kubernetes. It demonstrates modern backend development principles, including event-driven architecture, messaging queues, CI/CD automation, and infrastructure monitoring.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Node.js & TypeScript	Backend services implementation
Express	API layer for handling requests
PostgreSQL	Order storage (relational DB)
MongoDB	Inventory & analytics storage (document DB)
Kafka	Event-driven messaging between services
Redis	Caching for notifications or frequently accessed data
Docker	Containerization for portability
Kubernetes	Orchestration and scaling microservices
GitHub Actions	CI/CD pipeline for automated builds & deployments
Prometheus & Grafana	Monitoring and performance metrics
ELK/EFK Stack	Centralized logging for debugging and analytics
📜 Architecture Diagram
Here’s a simplified flow of how services interact:

 Order Service -> Kafka (order-created topic) -> Inventory Service
              -> Kafka (analytics-update topic) -> Analytics Service
Each microservice publishes and consumes events asynchronously, allowing scalability, reliability, and decoupling.

🔧 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Prerequisites
Make sure you have:

Node.js >=16

Docker & Docker Compose

PostgreSQL & MongoDB instances running

Kafka & Zookeeper (can run via Docker)

Kubernetes (Optional: Minikube for local testing)

2️⃣ Clone Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-management-system.git
cd order-management-system
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
cd order-service && npm install
cd ../inventory-service && npm install
4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
Rename .env.example to .env in each service directory and update:

plaintext
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/orders_db
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/inventory_db
KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
5️⃣ Start Kafka Using Docker
bash
docker-compose up -d zookeeper kafka
6️⃣ Run Services
Start services manually:

bash
cd order-service && npm run dev
cd ../inventory-service && npm run dev
Or use Docker Compose:

bash
docker-compose up -d
🐳 Docker & Kubernetes Deployment
Docker
To build and run containers:

bash
docker build -t order-service ./order-service
docker build -t inventory-service ./inventory-service
docker-compose up -d
Kubernetes
Apply Kubernetes manifests:

bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/order-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/inventory-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/kafka.yaml
Check running pods:

bash
kubectl get pods
📊 Monitoring & Logging
Set up Prometheus & Grafana:

bash
docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana
View Grafana UI at http://localhost:3000.

For logs, start Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana:

bash
docker-compose up -d elasticsearch fluentd kibana
View Kibana UI at http://localhost:5601.

🚀 Future Enhancements
✅ API Gateway for unified request routing ✅ Authentication & Authorization (JWT) ✅ Circuit Breaker for fault-tolerant microservices ✅ GraphQL support for flexible queries
